# Fallen Star

This Godot game was made during the 235th one hour game jam available on [onehourgamejam.com](https://onehourgamejam.com/)

The theme was "Nightfall" and I decided that the night would literally fall on you, and you have to shoot falling stars with parts of the moon.

You can see the game on [itch.io](https://zor-dev.itch.io/fallen-star)
